    Annotation class enabling numpy array validation in pydantic.

    library, to enable validation of numpy arrays with pydantic:

    .. code:: python

        typing.Annotated[NDArray, _NDArrayPydanticAnnotation]

    When supplied to a pydantic ``BaseModel``, this annotated type wil
    correctly validate an array passed to it according to the type
    provided:

    >>> from numdantic import NDArray
    >>> from pydantic import BaseModel
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> class MatrixModel(BaseModel):
    ...     matrix: NDArray[tuple[int, int], np.int32]

    >>> my_model = MatrixModel(matrix=x)
    >>> my_model.model_dump()
    {"matrix": array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])}

    Additionally, the annotation will allow pydantic to coerce the data
    type of the array to the correct type, provided this will not cause
    the loss of information (i.e. when converting floating point numbers
    to integers).
